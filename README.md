ABSTRACT 
Walking the dog, and other dog-related practices, have been suggested to be particularly car-dependent.  Secondary data analysis presented finds associations between the high energy use practices of car travel and dog ownership.  There is a strong association between the rate of dog ownership and car km travelled per person.  This relationship holds when controlling for income, level of urbanisation, housing type and demographic variables.
